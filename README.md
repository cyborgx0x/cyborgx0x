### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Lucas, Nguyen Khanh Thuan.

âœ¨ My purpose is value creation. âœ¨

My GitHub will contain the following:

- My personal project, contains many repos that I also upload here. Typically, I will upload all elements of my projects: should be ranging from the core feature, machine learning features, user interacting, data pipelines, workflow, deploying workflow, task distributions, project architecture,...
- Some of my experiments with new things: such as new languages, new techniques.
- Some open source projects that I commit to contribute.

âš¡ Fun fact: I will not publish anything related to my work in my company, since it is top secret
